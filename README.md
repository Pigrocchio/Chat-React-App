The idea of this very simple app was born, on the one hand, from the desire to learn how to program, on the other from a real need. Stuck at home by the pandemic, one Sunday we were playing Welcome To...via Skype with some friends.
To share the common deck, however, we were forced to keep a camera fixed on the table, complicating the life of those who were managing the game from a distance.



So the following days I wanted to try to take in hand some concepts of React, Socket.io, etc, and try to make our life easier during the next games. It's a very raw version (cover only the basic game principles), which still lacks a lot of things (code refactoring, private game sessions) and other small things.






### Tech: NodeJs, Socket.io, Express, ReactJs(Hooks,Context), Bootstrap
